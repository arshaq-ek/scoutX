## 🚀 Introduction
ScoutX is an innovative robotics project designed for autonomous navigation and intelligent control. The project leverages sensor fusion, path planning algorithms, and real-time data processing to achieve efficient movement and decision-making capabilities.

## ✨ Features
- 🔹 **Autonomous Navigation** – Uses real-time sensor data for obstacle avoidance.
- 🔹 **Sensor Integration** – Works with IMU, LIDAR, and camera for environmental awareness.
- 🔹 **PID Control** – Ensures smooth and stable movement.
- 🔹 **Custom AI Model** – Future integration for smart decision-making.
- 🔹 **Remote Control** – Can be manually controlled via keyboard or external device.

## 🛠️ Installation
To set up **ScoutX**, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/arshaq-ek/scoutX.git
cd scoutX

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🎮 Usage
1. Run the main script to start the robot simulation:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Use the keyboard or a remote device to control the robot.
3. Modify configurations in `config.json` to customize behavior.

## 📌 Future Improvements
- ✅ AI-based decision-making for navigation.
- ✅ Integration with PyBullet for simulation.
- ✅ Web-based control interface.
- ✅ Battery management system integration.
